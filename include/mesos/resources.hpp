/**
 * Resources come in three types: scalar, ranges, and sets. These are
 * represented using protocol buffers. To make manipulation of
 * resources easier within the Mesos core and for scheduler writers,
 * we provide generic overloaded opertors (see below) as well as a
 * general Resources class that encapsulates a collection of protocol
 * buffer Resource objects. The Resources class also provides a few
 * static routines to allow parsing resources (e.g., from the command
 * line), as well as determining whether or not a Resource object is
 * valid or allocatable. Note that many of these operations have not
 * been optimized but instead just written for correct semantics.
 *
 * Note! A resource is described by a tuple (name, type, role). Doing
 * "arithmetic" operations (those defined below) on two resources of
 * the same name but different type, or the same name and type but
 * different roles, doesn't make sense, so it's semantics are as
 * though the second operand was actually just an empty resource
 * (as though you didn't do the operation at all). In addition,
 * doing operations on two resources of the same type but different
 * names is a no-op.
